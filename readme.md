The users goal is to kill 10 green zombies.

#### Stretch goals

- Learn Phaser 3

- Keep the code organized using classes

- Set up webpack and babel from scratch

- Have a large world and a character that can move around in it.

## Challenges:

- Setting up webpack to build properly so that the application would deploy to Heroku.

- Creating the map and sprites from the tiles found online.

- Having the sprites collide with world edge and objects within the world.

- Get the projectiles to recycle when coming in contact with the world edge and objects within the world.
